                BSAX Java Build Instructions
                ------------------------------

Before building BSAX, you need the source package available from
the project's distribution web page:

    http://www.gregorpurdy.com/gregor/sw/bsax/

Download the bsax-j-src.X.Y.Z.zip files for the appropriate BSAX
release (where "X.Y.Z" is the version number) and extract it.
If you are using Unix, download the equivalent .tar.gz files
instead of the .zip files.

You also need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.4 (or 
higher) installed on your system. Before initiating any part of the 
build, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the installation 
directory of your JDK.

The Ant program is used to build everything in BSAX, including
the documentation. You must have Ant and the SAX apis installed,
with Ant on your environment's path (for the command-line ant
driver to be found) and you must have the SAX apis on your Java
CLASSPATH. To make building the packages easier, a Windows batch
file and a Unix shell script are included.

If you only want to compile the source code and make the JAR files,
run the following command on Windows:

    build.bat jars

or from Unix (make sure that build.sh is executable):

    build.sh jars

This will compile all of the source code and generate the JAR
files that are available as part of the binary package. After
building, these files will be located in the build/ directory.

If you want to build everything, including the documentation,
run the build batch file (or shell script) specifying the "all"
target instead of "jars".
